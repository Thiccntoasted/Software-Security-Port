Artemis Financial, a company managing financial data through a RESTful API, required an assessment to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities in their software application. The primary objective was to ensure the protection of sensitive customer and transaction data, particularly for international transactions, while maintaining regulatory compliance. The assessment focused on addressing security risks such as unauthorized access, man-in-the-middle attacks, and injection vulnerabilities. Modernizing the application by incorporating secure coding practices and updating dependencies was also a priority.

The vulnerability assessment involved a thorough manual review and static testing, which identified critical issues such as hardcoded credentials, weak cryptography, and outdated libraries. These findings highlighted areas requiring improvement and provided clear paths for remediation. Secure coding practices were emphasized as essential for preventing unauthorized data breaches, maintaining compliance, and preserving customer trust. By implementing robust security measures, the company strengthened its resilience against threats, ensured smooth operations, and safeguarded its financial and reputational assets.

The assessment presented challenges, particularly in identifying the depth of vulnerabilities linked to outdated dependencies. Detailed analysis and the use of dependency-check tools were necessary to address these issues. However, systematic processes, including manual reviews and static testing, proved helpful in streamlining risk identification and offering actionable insights.

To enhance security, several measures were implemented. Input validation and sanitization, strong authentication and authorization for API endpoints, upgraded dependencies, and improved session management and cryptography were key improvements. Looking ahead, Artemis Financial plans to incorporate automated scanning tools like Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) to continuously monitor vulnerabilities. By adhering to the OWASP Top Ten principles, the company can prioritize effective mitigation strategies.

Post-refactoring, regression testing ensured no new vulnerabilities were introduced, and functionality of sensitive operations was maintained under secure configurations. Secure coding standards, dependency-check tools, and robust testing frameworks were recognized as valuable resources for future security projects. This project demonstrated expertise in identifying and mitigating software vulnerabilities, highlighting skills in secure coding, vulnerability analysis, and risk management. Deliverables such as the vulnerability assessment report and mitigation plan serve as strong examples of the ability to secure software while maintaining operational reliability.
